## Changelog for version 3.2.5

### Added

- Added support for Shadowlands campaign quests background (same as the regular quest frame, with a Covenant glyph).
- Added support for showing campaign quests symbol in quest selection buttons.
- Added background for the Shadowlands zones.
- Gossip dialog choices (anything that isn't quests) are now shown at the start of the dialog, to allow bypassing long gossip paragraphs.
- Added manual scaling for a bunch of Shadowlands common models so they can at least fit inside the Storyline frame. More models will come as I replay all the quests.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with reputation quest reward choices being shown as invalid item (Cartel dungeon quests).
- Restored the possibility to alt-click and control-click on models to change their offset horizontally and vertically.
