## Changelog for version 3.1.0

### Added

- Storyline will now display backgrounds specific for the zone you are currently in (from the pool of follower missions backgrounds). 
- I was finally able to add the parchment object to the reading animation on the player model. Special thanks to Peterodox, developer of the [Narcissus add-on](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/narcissus) for his help on this.
