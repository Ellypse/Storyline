## Changes from beta 1 to beta 2

- You can now once again control-click an item to preview it in the dressing room and shift-click on an item to insert a link.
- Fixed an issue where the text of the rewards was sometime empty if the information about the item were still being retrieved from the server.
- You can now shift-click the Decline button to ignore/un-ignore a quest.

# Change-log for version 2.0 of Storyline

This is the best update to Storyline yet. We have addressed many shortcomings and greatly improved the UI to make Storyline an even better way to experience questing than before!

## Well…

No more Well… button! The system handling dialog options has been completely rebuilt to be highly dynamic and future proof. This new system allows us to show all the dialog options directly at the center of the Storyline frame, with scrolling if there are many options.

The options now have a nicer texture and handle long text or text with line breaks perfectly.

_Beta note: In this first beta, the font of the new dialog choices cannot be customized in the settings. This will be added in a future beta before the release version._

## A peek at the rewards

The system handling rewards has been completely rebuilt to be highly dynamic and future proof too. This new system allowed us to finally show the rewards before accepting the quest, right inside the objectives popup!

We have also improved the implementation of some rewards so they render nicer, like skill points, spells or followers. Finally, these changes made it really easy to fix the issue where rewards had empty names because the information were not download from the server yet, no more empty boxes!

_Beta note: In this first beta, some rare reward types were not tested (player titles, trade-skill learned) and may appear incorrectly or not at all. I plan on testing all reward types during the beta test phase of this version before it is released._

## Other enhancements

- Storyline will no longer open incorrectly when you loot an item that launch a quest or for quests that are dynamically added to your quest log. Clicking on the quest notification in the quest tracker will open Storyline.
- The dialog text frame is correctly resized when the text size of the elements inside it is changed.
