# Change-log for version 2.0.2 of Storyline

## Enhancements

- When a quest has no reward at all, not even XP, the reward popup will no longer be displayed and the quest can be finished directly at the end of the dialog.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a Lua error when data is not available for item objectives and the icon has to be refreshed.
- Fixed the dialog options icon staying greyed out after seeing a trivial quest.
